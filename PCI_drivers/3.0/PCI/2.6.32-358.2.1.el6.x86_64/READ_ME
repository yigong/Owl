                   astropci Driver Version 3.0
                        ( Apr 19, 2013 )
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This driver has been tested under the CentOS 6.x, kernel 2.6.32.xx.el6.x86_64


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
   Compiling and Installing
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Before compiling, you must make sure the following directory exists. If
it does not, then you must become root and create it. This directory is
where the *.ko file will be installed.

/lib/modules/`uname -r`/extra

To compile and install the driver, which will cause the driver to
auto-load on each subsequent boot, use the following commands:

%> make				( NOT as root/su )
%> sudo make install		( as root/su )
%> sudo ./Load_AstroPCI		( as root/su )

The driver should be installed immediately after system boot or the
system may need to be SHUTDOWN ( not reboot ), after driver installation
in order to ensure the image buffer memory can be properly allocated.

To unload the driver, use:

%> sudo .UnLoad_AstroPCI

Note, you must be root to execute some of the above commands or they
will fail. Check the following if the driver fails to auto-load on the
next boot:

1. The driver 'astropci.ko' exists in /lib/modules/`uname -r`/extra

2. Check that the module is loaded:

	/sbin/modprobe -l astropci

3. Make sure another version isn't already loaded:

	sudo ./UnLoad_AstroPCI

   Then re-load using:

	sudo ./Load_AstroPCI

   Then reboot.

   Allocating Image Buffer Memory
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The default image buffer size is 4200 x 4200 pixels ( 35MB ).
 
To change the image buffer size, edit the "g_ulSize" variable in the
astropci.c file to reflect the desired buffer size in bytes. The driver will
then need to be recompiled and installed following the steps near the top
of this file.

The system may need to be SHUTDOWN and restarted after these changes. DO NOT
just reboot; the system must be powered off completely before booting.
