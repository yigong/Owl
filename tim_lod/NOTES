Sub-array readout is implemented. Subarray readout is selected from a 
window accessible from the "voodoo" header. Binning is not supported. 
Readout can be chosen from either one of the four readouts, or from 
all four readout simultaneously. This is selectable from the Parameters, 
Readout window in voodoo. Binning is not supported.   
			
The high voltage bias supplied by the Berkeley board can be turned on
and off with these commands:

	BON		Bias ON
	BOF		Bias OFf (default)

The bias voltage is controlled by the constant HV_BIAS located in the
"LBNL.waveforms" file, entered as a decimal voltage. The ramping rate
RATE time is also entered in this file. The turn on and off times are 
both 1.4 seconds. 

Note that video processor gain will need to be chosen once you get
the system running. This is controlled by the dual slope integration 
time and the line in the waveforms file: 

	DC	VID0+$0D000C			; Gain from 0 to $F

Details can be found in the video processor user's manual. 

However, the clocking waveforms are obviously wrong, as parallel up 
is the same as down and split, and serial left is the same as serial 
right and split. I was unwilling to proceed too far down this path
without better documentation of the register structure of the 
LBNL 3.5k x 3.5k CCD.
